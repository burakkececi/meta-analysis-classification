# üßê Meta Analysis Classification Task

## üìù Description
This work focuses on conducting a meta-analysis classification task on three health topics: "kidney disease," "type 2 diabetics," and "brain injury." The goal is to prepare a dataset, apply classification techniques, and experiment with regularization and parameter tuning to improve accuracy scores.

### Preparing the Dataset

To perform the meta-analysis classification task, we will use Python libraries to extract meta information and full texts from open-source papers related to the selected health topics. Specifically, we will focus on parsing the "Conclusion" section of each paper and splitting paragraphs if present.

Steps:
- Utilize Python libraries to extract meta information and full texts from open-source papers.
- Parse the "Conclusion" section of each paper.
- Split paragraphs in the "Conclusion" section if present.

### Selecting Classification Techniques

For the classification task, we will employ at least four classification techniques using Sklearn algorithms. The goal is to obtain accuracy scores for each technique and prepare an evaluation table.
Steps:

- Choose and implement at least four classification techniques.
- Apply Sklearn algorithms to each technique.
- Evaluate and record accuracy scores in an organized table.

### Applying Regularization and Experimenting with Parameters

To enhance initial accuracy scores, regularization techniques will be applied, and parameters of the selected (the best) techniques will be experimented with.

Steps:
- Apply regularization techniques to the selected techniques.
- Experiment with parameters to improve accuracy scores.
- Illustrate improvements based on the accuracy scores.
